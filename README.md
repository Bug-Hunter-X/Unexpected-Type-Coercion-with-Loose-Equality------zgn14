This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (==) and its potential for unexpected type coercion.  The bug.js file contains code that illustrates the issue.  The bugSolution.js file shows how to use strict equality (===) to avoid this problem and provides more robust type checking for null values.  Always prefer strict equality (===) for reliable comparisons in JavaScript.
